    Objective function and constrians are the main components and should be written in the SymPy syntax.
    Depending on the selcted solver, these parts can be used separately or, e.g., as a Quadratic Unconstrained
    Binary Optimization (QUBO) formularion.

    If the QUBO is provided, it should be passed to the objective_function and the constraints should be empty.
